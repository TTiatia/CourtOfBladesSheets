## Playbooks and Coteries
Filling in the title of a Playbook ("The Bravo", "The Couth", "The Curse", etc.) or House ("House Battalia", "House Al-Mari", "House Elanda" etc.) will automatically fill out the sheet with the appropriate abilities and descriptions.

Similarly, when adding new Playbook or Coterie abilities, if you fill out the name of an existing ability then the description will be populated for you.

## Settings
All sheet settings can be configured from within the game, under the "Settings" page of the sheet.
